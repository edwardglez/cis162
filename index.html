    <h1>Edward Gonzalez</h1>
    <p>Hey, I'm Edward Gonzalez, and I'm currently enrolled in CIS 162. I returned to Cerritos after a long hiatus and decide to pursue an AA in Computer Sciences with and emphasis on Programmer. Last year I decided to enrolled in a software development bootcamp and that's the main reason I'm back in school. I want to acquire as much knowledge as I can since I decided to change careers. Prior to software development I was a Desktop Support Technician for about 6 years. The change is a very drastic one as I've been in the tech world for a while now. Looking forward to learning and strenthening my HTML/CSS skills.</p>
